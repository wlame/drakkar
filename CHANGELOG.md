# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- CI now scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities on every run
  (`pip-audit` against the installed environment), backed by a weekly
  Dependabot job that tracks both Python package and GitHub Actions
  updates.
- A scheduled nightly workflow runs the full Docker-based integration
  harness against real Kafka, Postgres, Mongo, and Redis.

### Changed

- **The MongoDB sink now uses PyMongo's async client instead of the
  deprecated `motor` driver.** No configuration change is required, and
  `motor` is no longer a dependency.
- The test suite now installs `httpx2` alongside `httpx` so Starlette's
  `TestClient` stops warning about the older client. This is a test-only
  change — production code (`drakkar/sinks/http.py`,
  `drakkar/uihost/fetch.py`) still uses `httpx`.
- Fixed-duration sleeps in the test suite that only waited for a
  condition were replaced with condition polling, and a flaky
  echo-duration assertion now bounds against measured wall-clock time
  instead of a near-vacuous positivity check. This does not meaningfully
  change suite runtime; it removes a source of intermittent failures.
- The minimum test coverage floor rose from 75% to 95%.

### Fixed

- The Kubernetes reference manifests in `deploy/k8s/` configured a retired
  `debug:` config section and a `DK_DEBUG__AUTH_TOKEN` environment
  variable, either of which prevents a worker from starting. They now use
  `ui:` and `DK_UI__AUTH_TOKEN`, and a test loads every shipped manifest
  through the real config loader.
- Reaping a subprocess after `SIGKILL` is now bounded at 5 seconds, so a
  process wedged in uninterruptible I/O can no longer hang worker
  shutdown.
- The README's trust-model section now describes all three
  `kafka.on_parse_error` policies (`skip`, `dlq`, `raise`) instead of
  only the default, so the documented behavior for an unparseable
  message matches what actually happens.
- The MongoDB sink's per-document fallback (used when a batch insert
  fails) now strips the `_id` PyMongo writes back into a document's
  dictionary before resending it. Previously that leftover `_id` made the
  retry collide with the document Mongo had already inserted, so the
  fallback reported the wrong document as the failure and gave up before
  reaching the one that actually failed. On a partly-failed batch the
  error now identifies the document that really caused it, and every
  document ahead of it is delivered — at the cost of documents the failed
  batch had already written being written again under a new `_id`.
  Documents after the failing one are still not attempted in that call,
  unchanged from the pre-batching behavior.

### Security

- **`executor.env_inherit_deny` additionally withholds `*PASSWD*` and
  `*SALT*` from subprocess environments.** If a handler binary relies on
  a parent environment variable matching either pattern, pass it
  explicitly via `executor.env` or `ExecutorTask.env`.
- The flight recorder redacts a broader set of secret-looking variable
  names before writing them to its debug database — `*AUTH*`,
  `*PRIVATE*`, `*CERT*`, `*SALT*`, `*PASSWD*`, and `*KEY*` anywhere in the
  name, rather than only as a `_KEY` suffix.
- The reference Kubernetes deployment now runs unprivileged (non-root
  UID/GID, all Linux capabilities dropped, a `RuntimeDefault` seccomp
  profile) with a read-only root filesystem.
- Upgraded the dependencies flagged by the new CVE scan.
